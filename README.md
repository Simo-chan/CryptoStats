-is a simple cryptocurrency tracker for everyday use, that was build using Kotlin, Coroutines, Ktor and etc.


## Overview

- **<ins>Main Screen</ins>**\
  
  After :dizzy:**splash screen** and custom built :boom:**shimmer loading effect**, the main screen presents us the list of top 100 crypto coins by market capitalization using [CoinCap API](https://coincap.io/) as data source. Also on the screen a floating button appears as you scroll down, when pressed it takes you back to the top of the list, so you don't have to scroll up yourself thus saving approximately 0.86 seconds of your life.

 On the same screen there's a theme change button that allows you to choose between Light and Dark modes, which will persist across configuration changes and app process death by saving your preferences in DataStore. You could also notice :dizzy:**fabilous** custom bult **animation** when the button is triggered.
